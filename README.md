Shared dataset for "Age-Related Differences in Task-Specific Functional Connectivity in 
the Context of Phonological and Semantic Cognitive Tasks with Distracting Words"


Functional data of a fast event-related design from 19 younger adults (19-35 years of 
age, mean = 25.0; 10 male) and 19 older adults (59-76 years of age, mean = 67.3; 9 male) 
post - GLM analysis.

Two tasks (Phonological match/mismatch and semantic match/mismatch) are provided, with 
Match trials separated from Mismatch trials:
PhonM = Phonological Match
PhonNM = Phonological Non-Match
SemM = Semantic Match
SemNM = Semantic Non-Match

For each of the above 8 files (file per run) are provided per participant. E.g. 
./OAs/201/PhonM_Run1.csv holds the data for an older adult (ID 201) for the phonological 
Matcha trials during run 1. The data are provided as time series (rows) per regions of 
interest (ROI; columns). 

ROIs: functionally based ROIs, restricted by 111 anatomical cortical and subcortical 
ROIs in the Harvard-Oxford atlase with maximum probability through 50 percent). See 
meta.xlsx for ROIs' names (as well as participants' age and sex).

YAs = Younger adults; OAs = Older adults
